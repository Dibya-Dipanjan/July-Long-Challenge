# July-Long-Challenge
**For EITA Problem statement: Chefland has 7 days in a week. Chef is very conscious about his work done during the week.
There are two ways he can spend his energy during the week. The first way is to do x units of work every day and the second way is to do y (>x) units of work for the first d (<7) days and to do z (<x) units of work thereafter since he will get tired of working more in the initial few days. Find the maximum amount of work he can do during the week if he is free to choose either of the two strategies**

**For RELATIVE Problem Statement: In Chefland, the speed of light is c m/s, and acceleration due to gravity is g m/s2.
Find the smallest height (in meters) from which Chef should jump such that during his journey down only under the effect of gravity and independent of any air resistance, he achieves the speed of light and verifies Einstein's theory of special relativity.**
